Mhc rfid
From: Mhc wiki - gnu linux and rfid fun



what for?
mhc_rfid is a small program to test phidgets rfid reader, it will read tag to output hex value and turn on external led for testing.

note that only external led will turn on with successfully read tag, not internal led or +5v output.

i would like to give credits to all people that i copied from like web site C tutorials, phidgets example code and code from phidgets forums...

fell free to contact me for any info, comments and improvement of this code.
